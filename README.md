# TPM Values Comparison Script

## Overview

This Python script compares TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values for a list of genes from two different datasets. It identifies genes with differing TPM values between the two datasets and writes these discrepancies to a text file.

## Purpose

- **Validate Data Consistency:** Ensure the TPM values between two datasets or experiments are consistent.
- **Quality Control:** Detect and document any discrepancies in TPM measurements.
- **Reporting:** Provide a clear record of differing TPM values for further analysis or reporting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
